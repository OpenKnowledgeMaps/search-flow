# search-flow
This package provides a modular, customizeable workflow for creating knowledge maps with Headstart. It is written in PHP and JavaScript and intended for use in PHP-based websites

## Usage
Drop the package into your example or add it as a submodule. In a next step, copy and rename config.ini to config_local.ini and set the paths to Headstart and the search-flow module on your webserver.

## Notes
The current implementation is extracted from https://github.com/OpenKnowledgeMaps/project-website and turned into a reusable package. As such, there is of course room for improvement; but the package should nevertheless alleviate the process of rewriting the search-flow for every Headstart integration.
